<h1>The Best Movies According to Ved</h1>
<h2>My 3 Favorite Movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Hitman's Bodyguard</h3>
<p>
  Two stars holding guns out towards the audience on the poster = buddy cop who
  action movie! Think of over-the-top crazy action set pieces, car chases,
  shootouts where the bad guys fall like cockroaches after a bug bomb, much
  explosions, scenes where they fall or jump some ridiculous height, paired with
  "hip" buddy repartee (like what they used to do in the Lethal Weapon series or
  any buddy cop action movie). Jackson, Reynolds, Hayak, and Oldman are old
  hands at this. A few times that shows. Still, movie fun. And, of course, love
  Amsterdam locations.

<h3>Ford vs Ferrari</h3>
<p>
  Based on a fascinating true story, Ford v Ferrari is a compelling period drama
  from director James Mangold. When Enzo Ferrari insults Henry Ford II, Ford
  hires American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles to develop a
  race car to defeat Ferrari and win the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Starring Matt
  Damon, Christian Bale, Jon Bernthal, Josh Lucas, and Caitriona Balfe, the film
  has a good cast that delivers some strong performances. And the script is
  especially well-written, making it easy to follow the car and racing jargon.
  Also, the racing scenes are incredibly exciting and kinetic. Ford v Ferrari is
  a captivating film about determination and the strength of the human spirit.

<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>
<p>
  Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is a really nice feel-good film about friendship and
  the pleasures of life. Its not particularly deep, and its damn predictable but
  the good cast and lively presentation easily top the few weaknesses.
